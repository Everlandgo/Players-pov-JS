# Players-pov
A website that plays the POV of the teammates of a game match/round at the same time. 

<h3>Update!</h3>
Due to the deactivation of the Cloudinary account, the code may be impeded, potentially leading to adverse outcomes.

<h3>Steps:</h3>
You need to add your mysql username and passw to the '.env' file. 

For example, my `.env` file looks like this:
```
CLOUD_NAME = 'dvapwslkg'
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = '247173229232398',
CLOUDINARY_SECRET = '5i3j4yQrH7GXKp-tZxk1BBOgOS8'
MYSQL_USERNAME = 'root'
MYSQL_PASSW = 'Password_123'
```

Then run the following commands:

`npm i`

`npx sequelize-cli db:create`

`npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`

`npm start`

`npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all`
